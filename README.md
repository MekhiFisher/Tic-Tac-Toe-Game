"# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game. This is the same game everyone grew up playing. There are boxes that are numbered and you press the number for the box you want to claim. Player one will start with 'X' and after his selection player two will place an 'O'. Who ever gets three in a row or diagonally will win. There can also be draws."
